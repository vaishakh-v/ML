# Project Name
### ChakGo_Scan

ChakGo_Scan is a Machine learning model developed as part of Build From Home organized by Tinkerhub. This project is trained to distinguish between photo of Chakka or Manga ( Jackfruit or Mango). we came up with the name Chak(CHAKka)Go(manGO)_ Scan.We, a bunch of students have used tensorflow and keras for this ML code.

ChakGo_Scan is an easy to use platform for anyone who wants to check whether an image is Chakka or Manga. Simply open the Final_project.ipynb file and upload your picture

# How it works
The project is divided into 3 colab files. The first one, namely '[Image dataset using selenium](https://github.com/vaishakh-v/ML/blob/main/ChakGo_scan/Dataset/image_dataset_using_selenium.ipynb)' is used to generate dateset from the internet and to scrape the images as per our criteria.
- We have used selenium framework to generate images.
- Parameters are passed as a CSV file.
- The downloaded images are scrapped as 224 x 224 and ensured to be RGB colourspace.
- We have also included a feature to add and scrape images from Google drive.
- All these images can be downloaded as a zip file.

The second file, namely '[Model training](https://github.com/vaishakh-v/ML/blob/main/ChakGo_scan/Model/Model_training.ipynb)' is used to train our model with our dataset.
- Import dataset from Google drive.
- Grouped the images as training dataset and validation dataset.
- Data Augmentation technique is used to enlarge our dataset size.
- We imported the CNN model 'VGG16' from Tensorflow using keras library.
- Since this is a Binary classification, we need not train all the layers of 'VGG16'.
- Parameters are added to the model as per the criteria.
- Model is trained using our Augmented dataset with 10 Epochs.
- Trained model is saved into the Google drive.

The final file, namely '[Final Project](https://github.com/vaishakh-v/ML/blob/main/ChakGo_scan/Model/final_project.ipynb)' is where the user tests an image
- The model is imported from Google drive.
- The user can upload an image and predict if the image contain "Chakka" or "Manga".
- The results shows the uploaded image and the fruit type.

# How to configure
- Open the 'Final project.ipynb' in a jupyter notebook.
- Mount the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1GTCZ1lGjCFnUursejAOqYLMaFUJhKUt0).

# How to run
- Open the 'Final project.ipynb'
- Load the model from Google drive.
- Add a test image.
- Pass the image as a parameter to the model.
- Chakka/Manga/Sorry I cannot identify this image, as well as the upoaded picture will be displayed.
